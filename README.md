## Source Code
The concierge-web.zip contains the source code for the web application. This does not include the /node_modules (because that made the zip too big to upload). So before running this, do an 'npm install'. The link for the concierge-web repo is: https://github.com/HeatherJoYoung/concierge-web
The concierge-api.zip contains the source code the the API. The link for the concierge-api repo is: https://github.com/HeatherJoYoung/concierge-api

The instructions for setting up and running the application locally are documented in the _Running Concierge App Locally_ file. 

# Tests
The unit tests are included in the source code for concierge-web. There are no tests for concierge-api at this time.
